# Image Difference and Background Removal

This repository contains two Python programs aimed at processing images:

1. **Image Difference and Bounding Box Highlighting**: This program, named `image_difference.py`, detects differences between two input images and highlights them using bounding boxes.
2. **Background Removal**: The second program, named `delete_backgroung.py`, removes the background from an image based on a specified bounding box.

## Instructions

### Image Difference and Bounding Box Highlighting

To use the `image_difference.py` program:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

3. Place your input images in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script and provide the filenames of the two images to compare:

```bash
python add_bounding_box.py dublin.jpg dublin_edited.jpg
```

5. The program will generate an output image named `dublin_bbox.jpg`, where the differences between the two images are highlighted with bounding boxes.

### Background Removal

To utilize the `delete_backgroung.py` program:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

3. Ensure that the `add_bounding_box.py` program has been executed first to generate the bounding box information.
4. Run the `delete_backgroung.py` script:

```bash
python delete_backgroung.py
```

5. The program will process the bounding box information generated by `add_bounding_box.py` and remove the background from the specified region.
6. The resulting image, `bbox_without_background.png`, will be saved in the same directory.

## Notes

- Both programs require the OpenCV and NumPy libraries. Ensure they are installed before running the scripts.
- Make sure the input images are in the same directory as the scripts or provide the correct paths when running the programs.
- Adjust parameters in the scripts if necessary, such as the threshold values for detecting differences or background removal.
- These programs are designed for basic image processing tasks and may require further customization for specific use cases.
